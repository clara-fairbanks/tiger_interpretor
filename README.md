# tiger_interpretor
Interpreter for Tiger language language written in Ocaml

This is an implementation of an interpreter for the practice language Tiger, defined here http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/181/tiger.html.   

The interpreter will be built upon a lexer which will transform the input language into a set of tokens generated by ocamllex.  Using Menhir to create a parser, the tokens will be inserted into an AST.  Resources for building the lever and parser can be found here https://v1.realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/parsing-with-ocamllex-and-menhir.html

From there, my interpreter will create a table of symbols using the generated abstract syntax tree using the map function in the ocaml stl.  The interpreter will perform basic type checking for the program, and execute the program.   

The initial phase implements a simple calculator, interpreting the mathematical expressions provided to the parser.
